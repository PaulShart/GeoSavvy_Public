# GeoSavvy_Project
The public repository for the GeoSavvy website project, created by Nathan Morgan.

This project is a geography-based quizzing website designed to help students at Fairmont State University test their knowledge on geographical topics.
The website includes user accounts and the ability for logged users to create quizzes, review quizzes, and delete their own quizzes. All users will have the ability to take quizzes.
Should a user need help, there is a "Need Help?" tab where users can submit support tickets, see another FSU quiz website, website rules, etc.

## Tech Used
HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, MySQL

This was a group project where I worked on the MySQL, Python, and JavaScript mostly. I would help with the HTML and CSS when needed, such as the "Reviews" and "My Quizzes" page.
The Python used Flask to communicate with the JavaScript to properly send information between the client and the server. We decided to do raw HTML and CSS to allow max customization and to become more comfortable with both tools in web development.

## Lessons Learned
This was my first experience with website development and I found it a lot of fun to work on! It was great to watch the website develop. It was also great knowing I created a little environment on the Internet.
There were a lot of complications with learning the Flask library and then applying it. It was a whole new library that I learned to use! The client-server connection was interesting to work with to make sure the data was properly displayed.
